Discription : Automatic Medicine Reminder is a mobile application designed to help users manage their medication schedules and healthcare information more effectively. It allows users to register with personal details, set multiple medicine reminders with specific times, and receive automatic push notifications to ensure doses are not missed. The app also includes a doctor directory, where users can store and access details of physicians, psychologists, cardiologists, and neurologists — including names, hospitals, specializations, and consultation timings.
The app is particularly helpful for elderly individuals and those with chronic or mental health conditions who struggle with medication adherence. With a simple and intuitive UI/UX, it aims to improve health outcomes by making medication routines easier to follow and ensuring users can quickly access trusted healthcare providers when needed.
